We chose to do the Face: Facial expression (emotion) analysis.

To run the facial expression analysis with our images, first fork or clone the repo, then run the file FaceExpressionDetection.py.
Our implementation of FER was inspired by https://github.com/WuJie1010/Facial-Expression-Recognition.Pytorch, and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/facial-expression-recognizer-using-fer-using-deep-neural-net/ .
